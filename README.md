# modelnet40_experiments
This repository contains experiments conducted on the ModelNet40 dataset. The ModelNet40 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for 3D classification tasks.

## Dataset

The ModelNet40 dataset consists of 12,311 CAD models from 40 object categories, with approximately 300 instances per category. The dataset is divided into two sets: a training set of 9,843 models and a test set of 2,468 models. The original CAD models are provided in the `.off` format.

The experiments are conducted on the processed data in `.hdf5` format. Each processed object contains 2048 points sampled from the original CAD models.
